Mechanism investigation revealed that the introduction of Ir can modulate the electronic structure so as to endow the Ru with the mild binding energy with the key intermediates and small energy barrier for *HOCH2CH2OH desorption, thereby enhancing the EG generation. Simultaneously, the high energy barrier for the overoxidation of the *CH2CH2OH renders the EG formation thermodynamically favorable, thus realizing the near 100% EG selectivity.
