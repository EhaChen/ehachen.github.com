Ex/in situ electron microscopy and density functional theory (DFT) corroborate that the higher the entropy of pristine NPs, the lower the surface energy, the smaller the average size, and the more uniform distribution after annealing. The prepared Pt high-entropy IMC (Pt-HEI@Pt/C) demonstrates high metal loading (40.53 wt.%) and small particle size (approximate to 3.15 nm), which endow it with an excellent ORR activity with mass activity (MA@0.9V, 0.65 A mg-1Pt) and durability over 20k potential-cycling. Membrane electrode assembly integrated with this catalyst delivers a peak power density of 0.96 W cm-2 and an exceptional stability (12.5% decline in MA) under H2-air condition at 0.1 mgPt cm-2.

This method efficiently transforms high-loaded Pt seeds/C into sub-5 nm L10-PtCo-IMC/C (44.3 wt.%) catalyst. Advanced characterizations and molecular dynamic simulations reveal that locally concentrated Co precursors accelerate atom diffusion and enhance nanoparticle anti-sintering ability. Temperature-dependent analyses further elucidate the structural transformation mechanism by tracking crystal structure and nanoparticle size evolution.
